# naperville_finances_PythontoSQL

This repo contains the Python script to load the City of Naperville's finance data from Python to Postgres SQL.

The Original data set can be found at city of Napervilles open data project (https://data.naperville.il.us/search). The data was downloaded from Naperville's open data 
platform then loaded into a Panda's dataframe where some minor transformations and cleaning was done before pushing to my postgres SQL database where all subsequent 
queries were performed

the SQL repo for this data set can be found at: (https://github.com/blombard24/naperville_finances_SQL_queries)
